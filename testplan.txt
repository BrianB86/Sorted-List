Test Plan for sorted-list

1) First we malloc each item and insert them into the list, casting them as void*.
	Inserted: 53,42,12,43,32

2) Create new iterator and print the list, it should print as:
	53,43,42,32,12

3) Then we remove 53, 42, and 12

4) Create new iterator and print list:
	43,32

5) Then we remove 43 and 32.

6) Then we create a new iterator for the empty list and print an error message if the iterator points to an empty list:
	"The list is Empty!!"

7) Once the list is empty we free our objects, list, and iterator from main.

Notes: 
	⁃	All objects must be free'd from main after nodes have been removed from the list.
	⁃	All nodes must be removed from the list before the list is destroyed, done from main.
	⁃	Iterators are free'd by the calling function.
